## What is spatial autocorrelation?

<!-- http://rfunctions.blogspot.com/2017/06/how-to-identify-and-remove-spatial.html -->

- Spatial structures play important roles in the analysis of ecological data. Living communities are spatially structured at many spatial scales (@Borcard2011).

- The environmental elements such as climatic, physical, chemical forces control living communities. **If these factors are spatially structured, their patterns will reflect on the living communities.**
  - Example: patches in the desert where the soil is humid enough to support vegetation.

## Spatial autocorrelation

According to the geographer Waldo R. Tobler, the first law of geography is:

> Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.

**Spatial autocorrelation can causes problems for statistical methods that make assumptions about the independence of residuals.**

## Spatial autocorrelation

Spatial data can be positively spatially autocorrelated, negatively spatially autocorrelated, or not (or randomly) spatially autocorrelated.

<small>
**A positive spatial autocorrelation** means that similar values are close to each other. <br><br>
**A negative spatial autocorrelation** means that similar values are distant from each other. <br><br>
**A random spatial autocorrelation** means that, in general, similar values are neither close nor distant from each other.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=15}
set.seed(1)

par(mfrow = c(1, 3))

m <- matrix(0, 9, 9)
m[1:4, ] <- 1

image(m, col = 0:1, xlim = c(-.05, .93), ylim = c(-.05, .93), main = "Positive spatial autocorrelation", cex.main = 2.5, cex.axis = 2, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n")
image(matrix(1:0, 9, 9), col = 0:1, xlim = c(-.05, .93), ylim = c(-.05, .93), main = "Negative spatial autocorrelation", cex.main = 2.5, cex.axis = 2, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n")
image(matrix(sample(c(0, 1), 81, replace = TRUE), 9, 9), col = 0:1, xlim = c(-.05, .93), ylim = c(-.05, .93), main = "No spatial autocorrelation", cex.main = 2.5, cex.axis = 2, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n")

```

## Moran's index

The Moran's index (**Moran's I**) is widely used to measure spatial autocorrelation based on feature locations and feature values simultaneously.

\begin{equation}
    I = \frac{n}{S_0}
    \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij}(x_i - \bar{x})(x_j - \bar{x})}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
    \label{eq:morani}
\end{equation}
where $w_{ij}$ is the weight between observation $i$ and $j$, and
$S_0$ is the sum of all $w_{ij}$'s.

## Moran's index

Moran's I can vary between -1 and 1 (**like a normal correlation index**).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=15}
set.seed(1)

par(mfrow = c(1, 3))

m <- matrix(0, 9, 9)
m[1:4, ] <- 1

image(m, col = 0:1, xlim = c(-.05, .93), ylim = c(-.05, .93), main = "Positive spatial autocorrelation", cex.main = 2.5, cex.axis = 2, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", sub = "Positive I", cex.sub = 4)
image(matrix(1:0, 9, 9), col = 0:1, xlim = c(-.05, .93), ylim = c(-.05, .93), main = "Negative spatial autocorrelation", cex.main = 2.5, cex.axis = 2, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", sub = "Negative I", cex.sub = 4)
image(matrix(sample(c(0, 1), 81, replace = TRUE), 9, 9), col = 0:1, xlim = c(-.05, .93), ylim = c(-.05, .93), main = "No spatial autocorrelation", cex.main = 2.5, cex.axis = 2, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", sub = "I around 0", cex.sub = 4)
```

## Moran's I

There are two types of Moran's I:

1. **Global Moran's I** is a measure of the overall spatial autocorrelation. 
2. **Local Moran's I** is a measure of the local spatial autocorrelation (e.x.: locally at each station).

## A working example

We will use bird diversity data (https://bit.ly/2BLOwdd) to learn how to deal with spatial autocorrelation.

```{r}
df <- read_table2("data/bird.diversity.txt") # Load tidyverse first
df <- janitor::clean_names(df) # Clean column names

df
```

## Tree diversity explains bird diversity

There is indeed a positive influence of tree diversity on bird diversity.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
ggplot(df, aes(x = tree_diversity, y = bird_diversity)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Spatial distribution of the data

Spatial pattern in the data?

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
ggplot(df, aes(x = lon_x, y = lat_y, size = bird_diversity)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Spatial distribution of the data

Relationships between geographical coordinates and bird diversity.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df %>% 
  select(-site, -tree_diversity) %>% 
  languageR::pairscor.fnc()
```

## Global Moran's I

To calculate Moranâ€™s I, we first need to generate a **matrix of inverse distance weights**. We also need to set the diagonal of the matrix to 0.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
sample_distances <- as.matrix(dist(cbind(df$lon_x, df$lat_y)))
sample_distances_inv <- 1 / sample_distances
diag(sample_distances_inv) <- 0

sample_distances_inv[1:6, 1:6] # Show a subset of the data
```

## Notes on the calculation of spatial weights

**Spatial analysis, in general, should not use lat/long when spatial weights are calculated.** This is because observations from distant locations can cause distortion. It is better to calculate distances based on spherical coordinates (projection based coordinates). This can be done using the **geosphere** package.

## Global Moran's I

We need to install the `ape` package to calculate global Moran's I.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ape")
library(ape)
```

## Global Moran's I

The global Moran's I is then calculated using the `Moran.I()` function.

```{r}
moran <- Moran.I(df$bird_diversity, sample_distances_inv)
moran
```

## Global Moran's I

Note that under the null hypothesis that there is no spatial autocorrelation, I is calculated as:

$$
I = -1/(N-1)
$$
where **N** is the number of observations.

```{r}
-1/(nrow(df) -1) # Expected Moran's I
```

Here, the **observed** global Moran's I has a value of `r round(moran$observed, digits = 2)`. Based on these results and the low p-value, **we can reject the null hypothesis** that there is zero spatial autocorrelation present in the bird diversity data.

## Local Moran's I

Now that we know that there is positive spatial autocorrelation, we can verify at which spatial scales this is occurring. This can be done using the `correlog()` function from the `pgirmess` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pgirmess")
library(pgirmess)
```

## Local Moran's I

```{r}
clog <- correlog(df[, c("lon_x", "lat_y")], z = df$bird_diversity)
plot(clog)
```

## A graphical view

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=7}
library(spdep)

nb_to_df <- function(nb, coords) {
  x <- coords[, 1]
  y <- coords[, 2]
  n <- length(nb)
  cardnb <- card(nb)
  i <- rep(1:n, cardnb)
  j <- unlist(nb)
  return(data.frame(
    x = x[i], xend = x[j],
    y = y[i], yend = y[j]
  ))
}

distan <- dnearneigh(as.matrix(df[, c("lon_x", "lat_y")]), 0.1185693, 0.5618655)
df2 <- nb_to_df(distan, as.matrix(df[, c("lon_x", "lat_y")]))

ggplot() +
  geom_segment(aes(
    x = x,
    xend = xend,
    y = y,
    yend = yend
  ), size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5,
  data = df2) +
  geom_point(data = df, aes(x = lon_x, y = lat_y), color = "red") +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude")


```


## Taking care of spatial autocorrelation

## Taking care of spatial autocorrelation

There are many approaches to account for spatial autocorrelation (we will see two today).

1. Include the geographical positions, i.e. **the latitude-longitude interaction term** in the analyses.
2. Explicitly provide a spatial correlation structure that describes the nature of the autocorrelation. 

## Method 1: Include the geographical positions

> - First, we create the *null* model where we do not control for spatial autocorrelation.

> - Then, to account for potential spatial autocorrelation we include the geographical position, i.e. the latitude-longitude interaction term in the analyses.

> - Finally, we compare both models to see if spatial autocorrelation is present in the data.

## Method 1: Include the geographical positions

Create the *null* model.

```{r, echo=-3}
# Simple lm model to predict bird diversity
mod_null <- lm(bird_diversity ~ tree_diversity, data = df)
tab_model(mod_null)
```

Based on this model, `tree_diversity` explains `r round(vegan::RsquareAdj(mod_null)$r.squared, digits = 2) *100` % of the `bird_diversity` variance.

## Method 1: Include the geographical positions

Create the model with the lat/lon **interaction**.

```{r}
mod_lon_lat <- lm(bird_diversity ~ tree_diversity + lon_x * lat_y, data = df)
```

<small>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
tab_model(mod_lon_lat)
```
Note the p-value of **tree_diversity**.

</small>

## Comparing models

We can compare the models using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC).

```{r}
AIC(mod_null, mod_lon_lat)
```
The results suggest that the `mod_lon_lat` model is a better choice. This further suggests that `tree_diversity` has a limited influence on `bird_diversity`.

## Method 2: provide a spatial correlation structure

<small>
Using a variogram (also called semivariogram) is another useful way at looking for spatial autocorrelation. A variogram shows how the total variance in the data is related to the distance between observations.

## Method 2: provide a spatial correlation structure

Variograms can be calculated using the `Variogram()` function from the `nlme` package. First, we need to create a Generalized Least Squares model using the `gls()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nlme")
library(nlme)
```

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# Create a null model
mod <- gls(bird_diversity ~ 1, data = df)

# Calculate the variogram on the model
semivario <-
  Variogram(mod, form = ~ lon_x + lat_y, resType = "normalized")
```

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
plot(semivario, smooth = TRUE)
```

</figure>

## Method 2: provide a spatial correlation structure

We will now test different spatial correlation structures and see which one is best for our data. This is done by setting the `correlation` argument in the `gls()` function.

----

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
# Model without spatial structure
mod1 <- gls(bird_diversity ~ tree_diversity, data = df)

# Model with Gaussian structure
mod_gaus <-
  gls(
    bird_diversity ~ tree_diversity,
    correlation = corGaus(form = ~ lon_x + lat_y, nugget = TRUE),
    data = df
  )

# Model with a Linear structure
mod_lin <-
  gls(
    bird_diversity ~ tree_diversity,
    correlation = corLin(form = ~ lon_x + lat_y, nugget = TRUE),
    data = df
  )
```

----

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# Model with Exponential structure
# mod_exp <-
#   gls(
#     bird_diversity ~ tree_diversity,
#     correlation = corExp(form = ~ lon_x + lat_y, nugget = TRUE),
#     data = df
#   )

# Model with Spherical structure
mod_spher <-
  gls(
    bird_diversity ~ tree_diversity,
    correlation = corSpher(form = ~ lon_x + lat_y, nugget = TRUE),
    data = df
  )

# Model with Rational Quadratic Correlation Structureo
mod_ratio <-
  gls(
    bird_diversity ~ tree_diversity,
    correlation = corRatio(form = ~ lon_x + lat_y, nugget = TRUE),
    data = df
  )
```


## Comparing models

```{r}
AIC(mod1, mod_gaus, mod_lin, mod_spher, mod_ratio)
```

Based on the AIC, we can choose between the **Gaussian Correlation** and the **Rational Quadratic Correlation** structures.

## Variogram on the residuals

The quick inspection of the variogram calculated on the residuals confirms that the spatial structure is gone.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
semivario <- Variogram(mod_gaus, form = ~lon_x + lat_y, resType = "normalized")
plot(semivario, smooth = TRUE)
```

## Comparing models

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tab_model(mod1, mod_gaus, dv.labels = c("NULL model", "Gaussian model"))
```

After modeling the spatial structure in the data, `tree_diversity` is not significant.

## Take home messages

- At first, `tree_diversity` seemed to be an important predictor of `bird_diversity`.
- Including `lon_x` and `lat_y` interaction in a simple linear model suggested that autocorrelation was present in the data.
- Moran's I confirmed that there was positive spatial autocorrelation in the data.
- Including a Gaussian spatial structure, based on the results of the variogram, modelled adequately the spatial autocorrelation.
- **Conclusion**: there is no relationship between `bird_diversity` and `tree_diversity` (we first identified a false positive in the data).
