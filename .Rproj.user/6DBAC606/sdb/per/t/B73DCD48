There are *at least* two good reasons:\n\n1. Reproducibility (ability to recreate what you did).\n\n2. Automation (run existing analysis on new data).\n\n## Why is it important?\n\n> It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the cleaning and preparing data. And it's not just a first step, but it must be repeated many over the course of analysis as new problems come to light or new data is collected (Hadley Whickham).\n\n## Why using R\n\nDuring this course we will focus on R.\n\n- It is a free software!\n\n- It is cross-platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux).\n\n- Has exceptional graphics capabilities (ideal for preparing scientific manuscripts).\n\n- Easy to develop your own functions (**automation**).\n\n- Allows to keep a trace on how analyzes have been done (**reproducible**).\n\n- Packages and active development (7342 packages available on CRAN).\n\n## Outline\n\nThis course will be divided into two main parts:\n\n1. An introduction to R (data manipulation, graphics, etc.)\n\n2. Statistical analysis using R\n\n## Class schedule\n\nHave a look to the printed schedule.\n\n## What I am expecting\n\n<center>\n<font size=\"48\">**Your participation.**</font>\n</center>\n\nThe best way to learn programming and statistics is by practicing. After each concept, we will do exercises together.\n\n## Project description\n\n- The purpose of this project is to use the R programming and the statistical skills acquired during the class to produce a report formatted as a scientific paper.\n- Prepare two or three questions to which you will answer using appropriate statistics and R tools.\n- Related to your own data (if possible).\n- Have concrete questions or hypothesis.\n- Objective: **produce publication ready material (tables, figures)**\n- Deadline: **no later than January 29th**.\n\n## Installing R and RStudio\n\n*Download R* https://cran.r-project.org/\n\n**I strongly recommend to install RStudio as your integrated developing environment (IDE).**\n\n*Download RStudio* http://bit.ly/1HlIr0q\n\n*Class notes* https://goo.gl/44bSRd\n\n",
